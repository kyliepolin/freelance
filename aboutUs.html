<p> Wizard Web Deesign was founded by Kylie Polin. After taking a web design class, she instantly became interested in web design. She knew that this is what she wanted to do. Kylie started off making basic websites about her life, one of those site being a holiday site that descibed tradtions her and her family would do during christmas. Her second site was a website she made for a client. The website was for Francine Mocha, who was opening up cafe. Kylie created her freelance site and is hoping to find her next client to work with. So far, Kylie is the only one in the company. However, she is planning on hiring other people to help her create more website at a faster rate   </p>
